## _Algorithms_ by [Jeff Erickson](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu)

This book is a must for algorithmic problem solving. You can spent days on single problems without getting any closer. If you are stuck in a problem statement, open a issue , and we can solve together.

### Additional Materials

The book contains only a small subset of my course materials; you can find hundreds more pages of lecture notes, lab handouts, and past homeworks and exams at  http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms, or at the mnemonic shortcut http://algorithms.wtf.  You can see the material in context at the web sites for my most recent offerings of [CS 374](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs374/sp2018/A) and [CS 473](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs473/sp2017) at Illinois.

At some future date, I am likely to incorporate more (but definitely not all) of these lecture notes into a future edition.  (I haven't decided whether I'm going to call it a "director's cut" or an "extended dance remix".)  One step at a time.
